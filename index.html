    Correlation is used to show the relationship between two variables. However, this only applies when the relationship between the two variables is linear. Not all relationships are linear; sometimes, the association between two variables is better described as a curve.

   Causation is when variables are the reason that correlation occurs. This happens when the variables in a data set cause changes or relationships within the data itself. This concept shows how certain things can determine correlation and how variables can largely shape a data set.

    There are multiple ways to visualize relationships. Some of these include smoothers, matrices, and parallel coordinate plots. Smoothers are lines within a graph of data (usually a scatter plot) that shows the line of the most correlation between the variables. This is quite similiar to the statistical concept of the "line of best fit", which shows the line that most evenly divides the points on a scatter plot on each side of the line. Matrices show data that has multiple variables. The provide a very general picture when looking at data sets. Matrices are often color-coded according to the strength of correlation. Parallel coordinate plots also show data that has multiple variables. These plots are special because they order variables in different ways to identify relevant patterns and are usually interactive to make it easier for readers to comprehend. These plots are usually more effective when readers can highlight portions of data that they are interested in, while graying out the rest of the data that is unimportant. There are pros and cons to these different visualizations, and there are certain reasons why we would use each one.
